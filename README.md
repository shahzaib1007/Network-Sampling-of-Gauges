# A Network Design Approach for Citizen Science-Satellite Monitoring of Surface Water Volume Changes in Bangladesh

## Abstract: 
In the face of globally prevalent water management issues, particularly in regions with water scarcity or inefficient management strategies, improved monitoring of water resources is critical. This study introduces a reproducible, integrated framework for gauge network design for tracking surface water availability in a citizen science framework. This framework is developed by drawing on an existing network of citizen-science and satellite-derived observations of water data in Bangladesh, a country with a substantial density of lake and wetland gauges monitored by citizen scientists. The primary goal of developing the framework is to identify the sensitivity of gauge density and their optimal location to most effectively capture surface water storage variations. The proposed approach incorporates hydro-physical variables such as temperature, precipitation, and terrain roughness, with the flexibility to include additional determinants like population density and socio-economic factors. To further improve waterbody representation, the study introduces two methods for fitting the Area-Volume Curve - the Robust Curve and Hydrologic Parameter Derived (HyPD) methods. For identifying optimal number and location of gauges, the framework uses Monte Carlo simulations. With randomized selection of gauges from the existing high-density network, the framework does not impose a single optimal solution but rather provides a range of optimal solutions, allowing water managers the freedom to select the number of gauges and locations in accordance with their specific needs. Strategic or optimal gauge installation sites are identified through a probabilistic plot, generated using random forest classification. Using the methodology, the study revealed how strategic placement of gauges can potentially improve the estimation of surface water storage variations. For example, the northeastern region of Bangladesh, given a highest density of water bodies, was found to require three times the gauge density that is optimum for the northwestern region having the lowest density of water bodies. The study findings can be used to enhance the validation of lake products derived from missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT). This research is expected to pave the way for more efficient global surface water tracking strategies, empowering water managers with enhanced decision making tools.
